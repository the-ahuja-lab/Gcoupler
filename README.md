### Introduction

Gcoupler, which leverages an integrative approach combining de novo ligand design, statistical methods, and Graph Neural Networks for rational prediction of high-affinity ligands. Gcoupler offers an efficient and comparatively faster route to explore endogenous allosteric sites of GPCRs, including the GPCR-GÎ± interface. <br/><br/>


The only strong dependency for this resource is [**RDKit**](https://www.rdkit.org/) and [**DeepChem**](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem) which can be installed in a local [Conda](https://conda.io/) environment.

A clone of the conda environment is 
```
$ conda create -c conda-forge -n my-rdkit-env rdkit
$ conda activate my-rdkit-env
```
